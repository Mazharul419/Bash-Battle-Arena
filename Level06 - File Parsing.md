# Level 6 - File Parsing

## Brief
![Uploading image.pngâ€¦]()


<br><br>

For this level my approach is using a parameter to define the file - then using the wc command output the lines the file has.

<br>

## 1. Creating .sh file

As usual file is created using `vi` and shebang line inputted:

    $vi level6.sh

in vi:

    #!/bin/bash

<br>

## 2. Create function

For these commands moving forwards - I will using functions for these scripts so I can recall them easily - this avoids having to manually type out scripts moving forwards.

To define the function - I will name the file `file_parser` followed by `()` and then curly braces `{}` where I will define what this function does.

<br>

## 3. Define parameter

To define the parameter - which is the file the user inputs, the $1 command is used:

    file=$1
